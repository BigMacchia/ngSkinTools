1.0beta.870
* "new layer" window will appear with empty layer name box, instead of having a "new layer" text in it.
  You can still submit the dialog without typing anything in, in that case new layer will get default name.
* Manually added mirror influence pairs now will be exported/imported to xml/json along 
  with other layers data.

1.0beta.865
* A fix to get Maya 2009 UI work again;
* Bug fix: paste weights to mask should properly work now;
* Bug fix: setting mask weights via API is properly undoable now;
* Bug fix: changing current layer while painting now properly highlights it's current influence;
* Bug fix: multi-layer selection now works for layer on/off action;
* Bug fix: long mesh names will no longer resize main UI window;
* Bug fix: update check window size should now be less awkward;
* UI code will now verify that plugin version matches UI version (this mainly solves upgrade issues,
  when old plugin sometimes gets loaded with newer ui) 
* API changes:
	added MllInterface.setCurrentPaintTarget(): universal way to set current paint target (influence or mask)
	added MllInterface.getCurrentPaintTarget()
	 

1.0 beta build 860
* Introduced weights clipboard:
	* A simple and intuitive way to move weights from one influence on to another;
	* Cut/copy weights for selected influence;
	* Paste weights on to another influence, either adding new weights to existing ones, or replacing them.
	* Cross-mesh copy/paste will only work if vertex counts are identical; this feature should mainly be used
	  on the same mesh.
* Changed how influence names are displayed:
	* Influences with unique names will display just short name, as previously
	* Influences with duplicate names will display a unique name in the context of the list; that is, if
	  rig contains two joints named "joint1", then they will be displayed as "joint1 (joint2|joint1)",
	  but behaviour will only occur if the list is actually displaying two "joint1" items.
	* The idea behind the change is to only show long names when short name is not unique in 
	  a skin cluster.
* Influences can be filtered with wildcards now; for example, "finger*_1" will match "finger1_1", 
  "finger2_1" or "L_finger66_1_joint".
* Minor API fix: MllInterface.getLayersAvailable() will work correctly on context mesh of MllInterface.
* Fix in import/export: internal layer transparency was being incorrectly calculated after importing
  weights.
* Stability improvements: setting vertex weights with sum above 1.0 could cause crashes
* Performance improvements: "import weights", "duplicate layers" should now be much faster 
  (and mirroring multiple layers - just a bit:)
* API additions: 
	* Batch update management added to speedup multiple update calls to internal layer data object

1.0 beta build 849
* Keyboard is now enabled in layer/influence lists, making it possible to go through influences
  with up/down keys (in Maya 2011 and up)
* Fixed: paint tool could crash maya in some occasions when skin layer data could not be determined from selection   

1.0 beta build 847
* Fixed: "Add manual association" in mirror initialization should be functional again.

1.0 beta build 845
* Maya 2012 crash on Linux resolved
* Update checker window fixed to show itself when update is found.

1.0 beta build 843
* Critical bug fix: unable to open ngSkinTools UI due to preference value type mismatch. 

1.0 beta build 842
* Reviewed some Linux stability issues when initializing layers
* Fixed: error message when opening ngSkinTools window for the first time

1.0 beta build 840
* Fixed: when exporting, influence names are now absolute;
* Improved direction display in mirroring window: now it will properly say "left to right", or "top to bottom",
  (depending on mirroring axis you chose when initializing mirror cache), instead of just "positive to negative";
* Mirroring now works with multiple selected layers; 

1.0 beta build 835
* Added new tool "Import Influences" for synchronizing influences lists between different skin clusters;
* "Delete current layer" became "Delete selected layer(s)" and now allows selecting multiple layers for deletion;
* Added "Duplicate selected layer(s)" in menus;
* Fixed documentation links here and there (apparently nobody cares as "View documentation online" menu item 
  actually never worked before);

1.0 beta build 830

* Added layer on/off feature, available from layer right-click menu.

* Added layer info import/export:
	* XML format available for all supported Maya versions;
	* JSON available from Maya 2011 and up;
	
* First attepts at python API:
	* ngSkinTools.mllInterface.MllInterface : low level access to internal plugin functions
	* ngSkinTools.importExport.* : import/export capabilities 

* Fixed a few Maya 2009 compatibility issues	

* A lot of refactoring inside the code, so possible stability issues, but it's all for the brighter future;
