So if we're able to target the Platform/Windows SDK's instead of having the full VS installations what's the equivalent SDK versions for each of the following:

VC6.0sp6 - Platform SDK Feb 2003?

VS2002sp1 (for sake of completeness)

VS2003sp1 - Windows Server 2003 R2 PSDK?

VS2005sp1 - Windows Server 2008 SDK?

VS2008sp1 - Windows 7 SDK?

Assuming there is equivalent SDKs for each of the above is there really any reason for keeping the older VS versions installed?

Or is it only recommended that we target previous VS installations?
