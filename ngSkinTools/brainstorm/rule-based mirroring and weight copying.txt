* Rule description is not tied to particular influence, but rather just a configured factory which is ready to produce
* Rule description produces rule instances;

* a rule answers a question "does this influence match that influence"
* a rule *may* answer a question "does this influence match that influence better than already matched influence"

* all rule descriptions are placed in a queue by priority; if a match is found, further rules are not checked.
