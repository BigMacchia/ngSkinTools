-- CURRENT FOCUS

* Cleanup of functionality quirks and holes:
	* influence limit for game weighting
	* interface visual looks
	* option names ant terminology

* Publishing:
	* Website is a cover page of the product: get it up and working.
	* Finalize UI organization
	* Documentation: cover everything
	* Startup tutorials: read documentation from first-time-user point of view
	* Automatic installation



-- FIRST RELEASE



* vertex selection: use any kind of selection (edges, faces)

* make rigid: need more options
	* make rigid by loop

* reduce influences per point:
	* make as separate weights modifier command
	* include as additional option to "relax","make rigid"

* "reduce influences" functionality:
	* hard limit: no more than N influences per influence
	* soft limit: when there's F weighted influences in influence, reduce to N influences
		: could be used multiple times, e.g.:
			0.2 weights: reduce to 4 influences
			0.2 weights: reduce to 2 influences
	* drop small influences: remove influence from vertex if it's below F influence



* assign by closest joint: "use intersections" is confusing option.

* assign by closest joint: custom joint selection should be less complicated.

* documentation needs strong navigation, examples:
 	drupal (http://drupal.org/node/250174)

* selecting joints for weights assign operation might be difficult when user
  wants to create a list of joints by multiple criteria, e.g. have in one list: 
  	L_ twist joints;
  	shoulder joint;
  	wrist joint;
  	
  in joint lister, there should be joint search and joint selection lists

* relax: limit influence spread to reduce garbage

* Finish buying procedure (building for given hardware ID, confirming payment - just review whole process)

* Documentation

* Finish tool window menu
	* online documentation

* Introduction video montage for voice-overs

* Influence lister basic functionality

* Tourist Zack
	* Create introduction and teaser documentation
	* Finish website with tutorial screenshots
	

* Retest everything on all Maya versions

* Utility shortcut buttons (paint weights/select vertices/switch model)

* plugin building for mac

-- LATER
* skin mirroring
	
	
* ? metajoints
* brainstorm on gathering user feedback/suggestions/bug reports. forum? wave? email form?
* brainstorm on documenting change log/bug fixes.

* Automatic testing (if gui opens, if relax/assign commands run successfully)
