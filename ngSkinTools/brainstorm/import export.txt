Performance
--------------
* can't implement "set weights" as undoable, as this would have to memorize current state for all the rest of influences;
	better would be to push weights into mll for all influences first, then call "set new weights" in one go.
	
from python side:
	* startUpdate()
	* add layer
	* set layer properties
	* set weights for infl 1  : no changes to actual weights
	* ... set weights for infl N
	* repeat any step
	* endUpdate(): use pushed data, undoable bit here




Roadmap
----------
* finish current test (ImportExportTest.testSave)
* implement influence matching by name when importing (currently using logical index)
* create python tests
* create python UI:
	* option dialog box: 
		* import mode: add|overwrite
