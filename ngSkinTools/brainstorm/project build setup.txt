Project Build Setup Rework
==========================

* Tasks:
	* Project must have a versioned build: it should be build with whatever
	  build setup that comes with it. Any changes to project structure might mean
	  that most up-to-date builder will not be able to build older project checkouts
	  
	  
* Workflow:
	* maintain a build script that builds its OWN project, with relative paths to it
	* should never operate on source code directly, putting results into ROOT/output folder
	
	* To build older project version, just have to check it out and run it's build script
