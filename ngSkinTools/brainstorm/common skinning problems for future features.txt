This document summarizes common skinning problems that occur in skinning process,
and based on those stories some features might be invented.


Common Problems
===============

Diagnosing Skinning Issues
------------------

* User might want to visualise his skin setup, e.g. see vertices/faces that a face 
  is influencing (select verts of influence)
 

Joint Replacement
------------------

* Some joints that already are skinned need to be deleted, replacing them with other joints.
  e.g. reduction/addition of spline joints: delete old chain, add new chain.
  
  
Weighting Merging
-----------------

* Merging two skin clusters - examples: 
	* one mesh weighted to head + jaw, other one to head+neck. User wants to preserve weighting on jaw,
      and on top of that, have the head-neck weighting.
    * rigging spine separately in different file than hands-clavicles setup.
