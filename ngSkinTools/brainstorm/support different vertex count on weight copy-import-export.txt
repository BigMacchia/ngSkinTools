
Feature brainstorm
----------------------

* usage scenarios:
	* from one character part to another
	* from one weights region to another
	* from one character to another
	* exported from old character mesh, mesh changed and weights imported back in
	* from one character to another (pose changed to fit character better)



* all operations should work between two SkinLayerManagers

 
 
 Roadmap
 ------------
 
 * Finalize ideas about how mesh information is exported together with skin information.
 	* the need of making inclusion of mesh info optional?
 	* is tri-mesh enough? (won't quads be used later?)
 	*  
 
 * get a transfer between two LayerManagers going on
 
 * Allow "import into in-memory LayerManager", and use that for "import on to similar mesh" scenario
