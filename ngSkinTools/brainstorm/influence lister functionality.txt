Influence Lister Engine Functionality
=====================================


-- RANDOM IDEAS
* blacklisting rules (hide always)
	oposite side influences (right side or left side)
  could be implemented as "only show from: left side, right side, middle"

* vertex-based listing options (list influences by selection, list influences near selection):
	* include nearby vertices (radius option, like skin relax)


* create toolset of finding a distance to influence:
	* visualising influence "shape" (string - influence with one child, tree - influence with many children, plane-influence with many children forming a shape)
