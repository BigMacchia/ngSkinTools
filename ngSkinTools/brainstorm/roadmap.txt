Roadmap
----------

RC1:

* smooth paint is somehow broken, smoothing down from 1.0 value fills the rest of the weight vector with the rest of influences in the list
	* review


* Short tutorials:
	* hand skinning tutorial
		* shortest influence
		* layer usage
	* influence filtering tutorial

* create "all" download version
	* include exe for windows, and archives for linux
	* provide additional notes file: general info about archive "plugin for maya", OS/platform/maya version selection warning, link to installation instructions 

* continue remote maya launch implementation
	* incorporate into the build
	* support using either raw python workspace or compiled one
	* support multiple mayas
	* support multiple os'es

* mll: review exception handling in createUndoableBit - possible memory leaks. 

* mll: cleanup mess in ngSkinLayerCmd
	* break into smaller methods

* mllInterface
	* continue with tests (set* tests)
	* continue with moving cmds calls to mll interface methods
	
	
	

RC2:
* run tests as part of the build

* Weight transfer:
	* provide rule list in SkinLayerManager::transferWeights

	* Add UI for weight transfer 
	* turn off upstream updates on setParent() for each layer, update after whole transfer operation has completed
		* incorporate this change into "load weights" algorithm, right now manager uses an "is loading" flag
		
	* add more options on how weights are transfered:
		* everything as single layer
		* everything as grouped layers
		* copy layers one by one
		
	* redo influence matching when transfering into more "civilized"
	  rule approach (rule priority list, etc). right now matching by 
	  position and by name is too hardcoded
	  	* each rule returns "rule applies: true/false", along with "how well it applies",
	  	  so that later in other attempts it can compare if match elsewhere was better;
	  	* rules should have the ability to be customized (e.g., name match should get left/right prefix customization)

	* implement nested layer copying

		
Unable to reproduce
-------------------

* more robust manager detection; test crashes in radec rig

* assertion error in init weights by closest influence;

* assign weights from closest joint fails, probably due to "use all influences" flag

Normal Priority
----------------

* implement at least some UI tests

* implement clustering by edge selection                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

* doclink:
	# TODO: validate documentation location
	# TODO: support multiple documentation locations


* transfer skin data: should be an undoable bit

* paint - review colors

* add rule on/off/order switches ?

* build: build test cases; make a testing targetl

* add "relax all layers", "relax selected layers" option

* Influence list needs some convenience utilities:
	* "Select influences to show" functionality;
		* "pin"?

* disable layer drag and drop UI feature
	* cannot implement, no such flag in treeview


* make influence filter keep it's value per-layer
	* with multiple skin clusters in mind - won't be a trivial task to do


* Any chance getting the marking menus for influence selection?
	* http://tech-artists.org/forum/showthread.php?t=419

* better algorithm for finding best weight on "floodToTransparency" is needed; closest by surface vertex maybe;



* need to rethink workflow for how separate shells smooth between each other
	* for character parts such as separated arms from shoulder, belt on a body, button on a shirt, etc
		* fuse operator? searches for a vertices close to each other and tries to unify weights of recognized pairs
		* adding invisible links for smoothing?	



* continue WeightsModifierEngine support
	* influence lister is failing due to bad "contained weights" received message
	* mask support: all the relax options should be available for mask as well
	* weights modifier engine should work either on a weight list or weight map;




* Layers Interface:
	* implement layer add/modify GUI
		* move layers around
			* change parent, 	
			* move layer to current mask/group 
		* merge options:
			* merge selected layers
			* merge layer down
				* merge by mask values, if they differ
			* merge children

* more relaxing options: 
	* relax loop
	* relax ignoring borders
	
* Make "smooth current" and "smooth all" brush modes; "smooth current" would apply smooth only where current influence
  has any weight (and potential vertices that can accept that, that is, neighbours)


* need all functionality for mask painting as for weight painting: 
	* make rigid
	* relax (volume, soft selection, etc)



* experiment once again about writing to lot of MPlugs at once

* redo "setup" and "cleanup" paint commands to C commands instead of MEL procedures

* Dynamic layers/effects:
	* weights update automatically to some rules, examples would be:
		* layer is mirrored (onto itself or into another layer)
		* 

* better smoothing tool: 
	* work in a relax-mode (no unrelated influences added, true smoothing effect of the skin)
	* full-stroke based (paint relax area, relax on stroke end)

* add "display mode" for layerColorDisplay:
	* current influence (as implemented currently)
	* all influences (current layer): colored display of each influence
	* all influences, masked away (current layer)
	* final weights - root layer weights, just easier to access than reading directly from skin cluster 
	

* "smooth everything for selected": smooth all layers, all weights, all masks: "i just want this area to get smoother" option.

* check if saving during paint operation leaves color display node in stack.
	* same goes for paint->undo


* further optimization options:
	* when updating whole layer (parent change, opacity change), don't use vertices that are not painted, or masked to 0.0
	  this will require layer to track all it's "valid" vertices.
	* shrink influences weight list (garbage collect-like style, so it does not happen
	  during stroke etc)
	* empty influences: normalize incredibly slow when setting values from higher to lower (e.g., flood 1.0 is much faster than 0.5 flood that follows) 

* new functionality: how calculates sum of it's children;
	options are:
		*stack: evaluate layers in order, adding them to stack and normalizing after each step
			* typical usage: layers override what's below; layer order matters
			* default behaviour of root group
		*multiply: sum weights from all layers, THEN normalize.
			typical usage: layers should blend friendly with their neighbours; layer order doesn't matter

Skin Weights update flow
-------------------------
* for every vertex, layer calculates and returns a final result of influence weights;
* this calculation should be cached, so that whole tree is not evaluated each time vertex is changed - only upstream.
* when vertex value changes, layer recalculates its final weight sum and notifies parent layer about the change
* root layer, after calculation, updates skin cluster.



Implementation
--------------

* Layers are a tree

* Layer can have different types
	* weighting layer: paint influence weights
	* DQ blend weight
	* mask layer: paint mask over children layers
	* group layer: simple group for organizational purposes; does nothing except providing on/off functionality
	* procedural: can also be an additional effect over a layer
		* limit weights to #
		* smooth
		..etc
* Layer blend mode:
	* additive: weights underneath are reduced to accompany new weights (if there's no alpha in new weights, old weights are lost)
	* multiplicative: weights are summed, then normalized
	* exclusive: weights painted on top aren't overwritten. 

* Each Layer holds it's "current influence" reference; using it is an option (user might want to stick to 
  same influence when switching layers) 

* when baking, each layer calculates it's weights before passing them to parent
	
* Storing
	* Don't read/write maya's values on the fly; read once ("load"), write each time there's a change
	* Values should be stored in skin cluster node, custom attributes
	* When paint tool is activated, attribute values are read into plugins native data structure;
	* While painting, new node values are written
	* at any point, layer values are "baked" into maya's native skin weight storage
	
* Painting workflow
	* display influences that affect current layer
	* 
	
* Color Display
	* there's "current value display" flag. can be many different things: 
		* influence weight in particular layer: set "current layer" and "current influence"
		* current mask selected: set "current mask"
		
	* display updates polyColorPerVertex node; 
		* anytime "current value display changes", whole
		  node is updated;
		* when user is paiting, only changed vertices are updated with color
		
	* when tool finishes, shape color display is turned off.

* Painting

-------------------------------

from maya import cmds
cmds.addAttr(ln="ngSkinToolsLayers",at='compound',multi=True,numberOfChildren=2)
cmds.addAttr(ln='layerType',parent="ngSkinToolsLayers",at='long')
cmds.addAttr(ln='influences',parent="ngSkinToolsLayers",at='compound',multi=True,numberOfChildren=1)
cmds.addAttr(ln='weights',parent="influences",at='float',multi=True)

cmds.getAttr('locator1.ngSkinToolsLayers[0].influences[3].weights[100]')
